            I'm playing a set at Laundry bar this Friday for the Little Monsters crew. We'd hoped to have a full night of dancing, but given the level 2 restrictions it's going to be a quieter sit down affair. I'll be spinning low key house and techno with my mate DJ Halo from 7-10PM, after which DJs Seraph and Sanoi will take you through to 1AM. If you're getting there early booking a table in advance is probably a good idea.

            For Sunday sessions I like to see where things go while keeping the mood relaxed. I can play for as long as I likeâ€”I'll usually be on for something under 3 hours, but this could easily end up being a lot longer if I'm in the mood ;). It's a nice chance to start off playing Soul, Hip-Hop and Reggae, then head off into other interesting directions. Ambient, Footwork, House, Dubstep; if it's not heavy and feels right I'll reach for it. Come down for a beer or a burger, and lets see where we end up.
