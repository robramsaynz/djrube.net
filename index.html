      <h2>Gig: <a href="http://www.laundry.net.nz/">Laundry bar</a>, Sunday 23rd Dec, 6pm</h2>
      <p>For Sunday sessions I like to see where things go while keeping the mood relaxed. I can play for as long as I likeâ€”I'll usually be on for something under 3 hours, but this could easily end up being a lot longer if I'm in the mood ;). It's a nice chance to start off playing Soul, Hip-Hop and Reggae, then head off into other interesting directions. Ambient, Footwork, House, Dubstep; if it's not heavy and feels right I'll reach for it. Come down for a beer or a burger, and lets see where we end up.</p>
